# crypto_correlation

The repository allows to compute various statistics related to Bitcoin such as correlations with altcoins, correlations with asset classes, market capitalization, price comparison and creation of Excel file containing graph and values relÃ²ated to both dynamic and static correlations.

The data storage is managed through MongoDB uploading different collections in the "btc_analysis" database. All cryptocurrencies values, especially prices and volumes, derive from another MongoDB database named "index".

In order to properly use the repository two main actions are needed:
1) install the requirements.txt file "pip install -U -r requirements.txt"
2) install the setup.py file that allows to use the functions contained in "btc_analysis" folder 

The repository has the following structure:

CRYPTO_CORRELATION
|
|--- btc_analysis --> folder containing all the functions needed in the repository
|
|--- scripts --> folder containing the scripts that upload the data into MongoDB collections
|
|--- dashboard --> folder containing the scripts that launch the dashbopard app

# analysis scripts

In order to effectively run the scripts the order of running is relevant. More specifically:

# 1) yahoo_series_update_launcher.py

    The script downloads the updated financial data from Yahoo Finance using the API and retrieves crypto's prices and volumes from the "index" database; then compiutes returns and logreturns.

    Once launched, the script updates the MongoDB collection "all_prices_y", "all_returns_y", "all_logreturns_y" and "all_volume_y".

    Moreover the script updates the collection "market_cap" and "btc_supply". Specifically, the supply update leverages on the API of blockchain.info websites.

# 3) usd_denominated_launcher.py

# 4) btc_denominated_launcher.py
